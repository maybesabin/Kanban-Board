## Technology Choices and Rationale

### **Vite:**
- Chosen for its fast build times and efficient development environment.
- Supports modern JavaScript and ensures optimized production builds.

### **React.js:**
- Provides a component-based structure, making it easier to manage state and UI updates.
- Well-suited for building interactive user interfaces like a Kanban board.

### **TailwindCSS:**
- Ensures scoped and maintainable styling.
- Provides rapid UI development with pre-defined classes.

### **Shadcn UI:**
- Provides a set of pre-built components for consistent styling.
- Ensures consistent styling across the application.

### **React Context API:**
- Provides a way to share data betweetn components without having o pass props down manually.
- Ensures that the data is shared between components efficiently.

### **Lucide React Icons:**
- Provides a set of pre-built icons for consistent styling.
- Ensures that the icons are consistent across the application.

## Known Limitations/Trade-offs

1. **State Management:**
   - Local state is used instead of a global state management library (e.g., Redux), which might limit scalability for larger projects.

2. **Backend Integration:**
   - Currently, there is no backend; all data is stored in the browserâ€™s local storage, meaning data will be lost if the storage is cleared.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Complexity:**
   - Drag-and-drop implementation may not handle edge cases such as rapid task reordering or multi-touch gestures effectively due to the use of React's inbuilt drag and drop feature 
   - The reason to use inbuilt feature instead of libraries like react-beautiful-dnd is because it is not yet supported for the latest react version and had some issues.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - While responsive, certain layouts might require further testing and optimization for smaller screen sizes.

## Future Improvements

1. **Backend Integration:**
   - Add a backend with a database to enable data storage.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Allow users to create accounts and have personalized boards.

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - Add support for due dates, tags, and task priorities.
   - Enable searching of tasks within columns.

4. **Accessibility Enhancements:**
   - Improve keyboard navigation to ensure the app is accessible to all users.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Optimize drag-and-drop operations for better performance with large datasets.
